# myTCPlistener
myListener is a small utility I've put together, today, using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.

The purpose of this utility is to setup fast and dirty a listener on a host on a specific port bound to all host IPs or a specific IP.

It has also logging functionality as well as silent mode.

Run **myTCPlistener.exe --help** to get all the parameters and information you can get for this small utility.

Hope you enjoy it.


Cheers!
