# myTCPlistener
myListener is a small utility I've put together, today, using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.

The purpose of this utility is to setup fast and dirty a listener on a host on a specific port bound to all host IPs or a specific IP.

It has also logging functionality as well as silent mode.

Run **myTCPlistener.exe --help** to get all the parameters and information you can get for this small utility.

If you want to check the post around it go to my blog where is also a short walkthrough video https://www.sqltattoo.com/blog/2020/04/coding-day-a-small-tcp-listener-just-for-fun-and-work/

Hope you enjoy it.


Cheers!
